TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 07)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done:<span style="color:green"> 5 committed and 6 done
- Total points committed vs. done: <span style="color:green">11 committed and 16 done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team):<span style="color:green"> 44h 05m planned and 52h 30m done

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)


<span style="color:green">
We didn't define any Unit tests since we didn't know how to write them, we planned to include them for the next sprints.

### Detailed statistics



| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |13       |       |    23h 15m      |       21h 50m       |
| _#1_   | 4      |  2      |      6h      |     9h 50m         |
|   _#7_ | 3        |   1     |    5h 15m        |   6h 45m           |
|   _#10_|3         |   3     |      3h 15m      |   3h 50m           |
| _#11_  | 2        |  2      |    1h 50m        |      2h 30m        |
|   _#14_| 2        |  3      |        1h 45m    |        3h 15m      |
|   _#9_| 2        |  3      |        2h 45m    |        4h      |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Estimate:
    - Average = 1h 36m
    - Standard deviation = 2h 13m
  - Actual:
    - Average = 1h 56m
    - Standard deviation = 2h 17m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 : 44h 05m /52h 30m - 1 = -0.16

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0h
  - Total hours spent: 0h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 0h
  - Coverage (if available): 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
- Code review:
  - Total hours estimated : 1h
  - Total hours spent: 1h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - <span style="color:green"> The lack of knolwedge of the skills of each group member lead us to an average underestimation of the tasks.
  - <span style="color:green"> The fact that we didn't include the E2E testing in our estimation.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - <span style="color:green"> We should start and complete a story at a time by developing and running all the tests before moving on to the next story. 

  - <span style="color:green"> We should learn to develop Unit tests and include them along with E2E testing in the sprint estimation.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  <span style="color:green"> -
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  
  <span style="color:green"> -

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Learn to develop unit testing for backend and frontend

  > More communication in the group

  > Have a better organization spreading our working time among each day of the week

  >Include E2E testing as a separate task and estimate it

  >Work on a story at a time

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!

  > We managed to have a presentable structured application in only one sprint and to organize the work splitting it for seven people that are working at the same time.
